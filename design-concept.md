I wanted to go for a design concept that was simple to look at,easy on the eyes. 
my goal was to have pictures neatly displayed on the page
while texts followed supporting the content of the page


I did not want to confuse my users by making it difficult in appearance 
and also, visitors should not have a hard time navigating through the page.
